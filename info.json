	"description": "This is a continuation of the RealisticReactors mod. Includes bug fixes, improvements and changes.\n\nThis mod adds a more realistic nuclear reactor, a breeder reactor and a cooling tower. The reactors are controllable via an integrated circuit interface, and have a dynamic output depending on their temperature. They need proper cooling, otherwise a nuclear meltdown will occur.",
